# PhyllosphereDynamics
 Models and scripts for simulating population dynamics from metabolic interactions between leaf-associated bacteria

========================

This repository contains the genome-scale metabolic models reported in Pacheco, Ugolini *et al.*, as well as the scripts required to simulate dynamics stemming from metabolic exchange using [COMETS v2.11.3](https://www.runcomets.org/home).

## Models

Located in the 'Models' directory, contains genome-scale models for *Sphingomonas* sp. Leaf257 and *Rhizobium* sp. Leaf68, two bacterial members of the *Arabidopsis thaliana* phyllosphere microbiome (*At*-LSPHERE, Bai *et al.*, 2015) originally constructed in Schäfer, Pacheco, *et al.*, 2023. The models are provided both in .sbml format for use with [COBRApy](https://opencobra.github.io/cobrapy/).

## Simulation scripts and output

Located in the 'Simulation' directory, contains files for simulating dynamics in COMETS between the two models in a minimal medium containing xylan. Time-resolved biomass abundances and fluxes for each model are contained in the 'biomassLog,' and 'fluxLog.m' files, respectively.
